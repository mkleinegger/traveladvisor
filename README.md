# traveladvisor
This is a school project I did with two colleges (Stefan Sonnek and Daniel Gilgenreiner). We did it in our final year of our higher technical school (HTL-Villach/Informatik). The TravelAdvisor is a web- and mobile-application, which should help people find atractions near their location and reward them for visiting them.
